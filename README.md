*  Firstly created a meaningful header, footer, banner, special recipes, chef and sponsors section then render the chef info json data from server side.

* All card has one button which is show details and onClick function is used to show more details of each chef details using their id. In details page one button is given on recipes and I use tostify on favourite button.

* Then I have created login and register page using firebase, useContext, useState, useEffect, useLocation, useNavigation from custom hook and setup route to identify the page link and also added private route for not accessing the recipes for unauthorized user.

* We access the user by login with user & password, google authorized and github authorized.

* In blog section we have answer 4 question.

* Added active link, react lazy load, react pdf generator, github, google, and password authentication. In registration page we check the password validation.
